# NYC Citi Bike Analysis
Used Tableau to create different models and charts to display bikesharing data in the New York City Area. 
Analyzed McDonald's data in New York and Des Moines to see if Des Moines would be a good choice to create a new bike system within the city.

## Project Summary 
The question to answer is What is the density of McDonald's in New York City versus Des Moines? Does this affect where people go in the city? If so, how?

### Resources
- Data Sources: 201908-citibike-tripdata.csv, ia_mcdonalds.csv, ny_mcdonalds.csv
- Software: Tableau 2020.1

### Analysis
The Citi Bike data showed that there was 2,344,224 recorded data with the demographic of the bike user were mostly subscribers over customer with majority being male users. 
The map data showed that most of the bike riding happened on the Manhattan Island with the majority of the start and stops being in the Upper Manhattan area. The peak areas also showed that bike were being used around 7am-8am and 5pm-7pm. These times are usually when people go to and from work. Lastly the avg. trip duration per each age group shows that there is a rise in the younger generation using citibike with an outlier in 1969 age group. 
The age user count also shows that there are an abundance of younger users with again another outlier in the 1969 age group.

The challenge analysis was to visualize the different McDonald's in the city of Des Moines and NYC. The total amount of McDonald's in NYC is 26 with 11 and 10 of them in Manhattan and Brooklyn respectively. Des Moines has 11 McDonald's in the city itself with a total of 20 in the greater Des Moines area. When looking at the McDonald's in each area, Des Moines has a similar McDonald's count to NYC in the Manhattan and Brooklyn area. When looking at the bike traffic areas on the Citi Bike analysis, Manhattan and Brooklyn are the most popular areas to bike in with former being the most populous. Having a bike share app in the Des Moines area can be a good idea looking at the data. The most popular biking spots have tons of McDonald's around the area in NYC and Des Moines has a similar McDonald's count as well. The correlation in the data shows that more people could be biking around areas with more McDonald's. People use bikes to get around places quicky and through traffic. McDonald's can be the perfect pitstop for cyclists to grab a quick bite before or after work.
